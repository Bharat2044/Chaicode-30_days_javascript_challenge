# Day 4: Loops

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: For Loop

- **Task 1:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
- **Task 2:** Write a program to print the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.

### Activity 2: While Loop

- **Task 3:** Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
- **Task 4:** Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

### Activity 3: Do...While Loop

- **Task 5:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do...while loop.
- **Task 6:** Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

### Activity 4: Nested Loops

- **Task 7:** Write a program to print a pattern using nested for loops:
  ```
  *
  * *
  * * *
  * * * *
  * * * * *
  ```

### Activity 5: Loop Control Statements

- **Task 8:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip the number 5 using the `continue` statement.
- **Task 9:** Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop when the number is 7 using the `break` statement.

## Feature Request:

1. **Number Printing Script:** Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop and a while loop.
2. **Multiplication Table Script:** Create a script that prints the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.
3. **Pattern Printing Script:** Write a script that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops.
4. **Sum Calculation Script:** Write a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
5. **Factorial Calculation Script:** Create a script that calculates the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

## Achievement:

By the end of these activities, students will:

- Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.
- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements (`break` and `continue`) to control the flow of loops.
