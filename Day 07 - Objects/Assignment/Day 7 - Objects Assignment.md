# Day 7: Objects

## Tasks/Activities

### Activity 1: Object Creation and Access
- **Task 1**: Create a book object with properties like title, author, and year. Log it to the console.
- **Task 2**: Access and log the title and author properties.

### Activity 2: Object Methods
- **Task 3**: Add a method to return a string with the book's title and author. Log the result.
- **Task 4**: Add a method to update the book's year and log the updated object.

### Activity 3: Nested Objects
- **Task 5**: Create a library object with name and books (array of book objects). Log it to the console.
- **Task 6**: Log the library's name and book titles.

### Activity 4: The `this` Keyword
- **Task 7**: Add a method using `this` to return the bookâ€™s title and year. Log the result.

### Activity 5: Object Iteration
- **Task 8**: Use a `for...in` loop to log each property and its value.
- **Task 9**: Use `Object.keys` and `Object.values` to log all keys and values.

## Feature Request

1. **Book Object Script**: Create a book object, add methods, and log properties and results.
2. **Library Object Script**: Define a library object with book objects and log details.
3. **Object Iteration Script**: Demonstrate iterating over an object's properties using `for...in` and `Object.keys`/`Object.values`.

## Achievement

- Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
- Use the `this` keyword in object methods.
- Work with nested objects and arrays.
- Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.
