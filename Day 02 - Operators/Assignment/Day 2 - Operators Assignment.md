# Day 2: Operators

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

* **Task 1:** Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
* **Task 2:** Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
* **Task 3:** Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
* **Task 4:** Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
* **Task 5:** Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

### Activity 2: Assignment Operators

* **Task 6:** Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
* **Task 7:** Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

### Activity 3: Comparison Operators

* **Task 8:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.
* **Task 9:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.
* **Task 10:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.

### Activity 4: Logical Operators

* **Task 11:** Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
* **Task 12:** Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
* **Task 13:** Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

### Activity 5: Ternary Operator

* **Task 14:** Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

## Feature Request:

1. **Arithmetic Operations Script:** Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.
2. **Comparison and Logical Operators Script:** Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
3. **Ternary Operator Script:** Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

## Achievement:

By the end of these activities, students will:

* Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
* Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
* Compare values using comparison operators.
* Combine conditions using logical operators.
* Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
